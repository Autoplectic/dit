Contributing
------------

If you'd like to feature added to ``dit``, please file an issue. Or, better yet, open a pull request. Ideally, all code should be tested and documented, but pleast don't let this be a barrier to contributing. We'll work with you to ensure that all pull requests are in a mergable state.

If you'd like to get in contact about anything, you can reach us through our `slack channel <https://dit-python.slack.com/>`_.
